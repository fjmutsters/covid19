## Project Description
In this project we have attempted to do an analysis of the time series data of the coronavirus pandemic which has been disrupting the world since December 2019.                       
We have specifically focused on the variations and trends in the confirmed cases , deaths and recoveries across a few countries in the world related to their population per million and density.

## Questions & Hypotheses
1.Is death rate (% of deaths compared to covid cases) declining?                                                                                                                     
2.Does higher population density leads to higher number of new covid cases (looking at second wave)?                                                                              
3.Was Sweden's voluntary lockdown strategy a success?                                                                                                                              
4.Some cool analysis of 8 countries of group

## Dataset
The time series data for the analysis is mainly taken from the John Hopkins University which is updated on a daily basis.                                                          
Dataset for demographic information such as Population , Population Density etc are taken from Kaggle.
 
## Workflow
Choose an interesting topic and gather a dataset with appropriate details and file format. 
Understand the data and come up with problem statements.
Perform data wrangling/cleaning.
Update ipynb / python file with interpretation using Pandas/python , visualization of data using Seaborn and Plotly.
Statistical Analysis including confidence intervals and Hypothesis testing.
Present the data insights with storytelling in a slide deck and evaluate the deviation of facts from hypothesis with proper reasoning.
Create a README file which describes about the project.


## Organization
A Git repository is created exclusively for this project.
The main deliverables are the python file , an updated README and the PPT.
The .py /.ipynb files detailing about the analysis are pushed to the individual project folder of the class repository.
Only the README file will be available in the data folder.
Any raw files / image files, data file(dataset)and the presentation file(.ppt) is uploaded in the google drive folder.
